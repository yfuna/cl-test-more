# CL-TEST-MORE - Yet Another Unit Testing Framework for Common Lisp

CL-TEST-MORE is inspired by Test::More, a module of Perl.

The advantages of CL-TEST-MORE are:

* Just one file to load
* Test with just simple functions
* Result format is "Test Anything Protocol"

## Synopsis

```common-lisp
(plan 9)

;; Various way to say "ok":
;; by checking if the first argument is true,
(ok (eq got expected) "the name or description of this test")

;; by checking if the value of `got' equals the value of `expected', and
(is got expected "the name or description of this test")
(isnt got expected "the name or description of this test")
;; with :test function.
(is got expected "the name or description of this test" :test #'string=)

;; Rather than (princ "# This is just a comment\n" *standard-output*)
(diag "This is just a comment")

;; Check a macro expansion.
(is-expand (got macro) (expected :like "this") "the name or description of this test")

;; Check an output.
(is-print (write-line "aiueo") "aiueo\n" "the name or description of this test")

;; A function always passes, and always fails.
(pass "the name or description of this test")
(fail "the name or description of this test")

;; Don't forget this.
(finalize)
```
